								 </h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								
								In the innovative office of Visionary Inc., the coffee machine was the lifeline for the employees. One morning, as everyone gathered around for their daily caffeine fix, they noticed a sign on the machine that read, “Out of Order.”

Disappointed, they all grumbled and went back to their desks. But little did they know, it was all part of a prank by their colleague, Lisa, who was known for her visionary ideas and playful spirit. She had secretly placed the sign to see how everyone would react and to encourage them to think outside the box for their caffeine needs.

As the day went on, the office became increasingly sluggish without their coffee. By lunchtime, Lisa couldn’t hold back her laughter any longer. She removed the sign and announced, “Surprise! The coffee machine works just fine!”

Everyone rushed to the machine, relieved and amused. But the best part was yet to come. As they started brewing their coffee, the machine suddenly made a strange noise and started spewing coffee everywhere!

Turns out, the machine really was broken, and Lisa’s prank had backfired spectacularly. The office was in stitches, and Lisa learned a valuable lesson: even visionaries need to be careful with their pranks.

From that day on, Visionary Inc. was filled with even more laughter and a newfound appreciation for their creative and unpredictable colleague. And Lisa, ever the visionary, started working on a new project: a foolproof, self-repairing coffee machine.
